# Today I Learned
**Learning journal in the TIL style** <br>

Daily updates could be anything from a new Swift feature (most likely) to a new tool, or programming concept. <br>
I'll try to keep them as brief as possible while still being useful to future Adam. <br>
Future Adam doesn't read walls of text. Neither do I. <br>
